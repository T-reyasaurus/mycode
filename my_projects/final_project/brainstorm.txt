Sooooooooooo I'm brainstorming... but my brain doesn't even know what to storm up because I'm still learning how to start a program and understand the syntax, arguements, pre built ins.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!. 

Okay calm down Trey.... Let's brainstorm.

How about a beer pong game that can be played while facetiming the homies... that sounds fun.

Ooooooo how bout..... A program that tells me my expected funds after I've estimated and planned things I want to purchase... just so I can know if wifey will yell at me or not for buying something without talking it over before I buy it... that'll definitely save me some conversations.

Okay okay... we getting somewhere now...

And lastly... A program that takes all of my family members birthdays ( the ones I care to track ) and automatically sends a message to them saying Happy birthday or a random pre built message that I've already made, so that way I don't have to check the calendar or track facebook (because I don't pay enough attention to it) and they know that I really do care and am thinking about them, even tho I suck at remembering to do that stuff. 

So to sum it up.

1. Beer pong game
2. Pre-budget expense Calculator
3. Birthday Message

I think that's good.
